Marketing data analysis with Power BI 

It is an academic exercise with a small dataset having 2240 data points.

I split the facts table into a facts_clean and a facts_noise. in the last one, I kept outliers (Age, salaries, .....) for further review by data owners.

A transformation into a star model with several dimensions, some DAX measures helped me elaborate the dashboards.

A PDF file shows dashboards with slicers.

The data source is available in CSV format in this repository.

You can download it. It will be necessary to relink the Facts table to the right origin within the DataTransform panel of PowerBI.
